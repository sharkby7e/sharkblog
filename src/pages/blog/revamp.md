### Getting back on the train

It's been a minute since I've written a post on here. I guess I've been pretty busy with my work at Backerkit! 
I've learned a ton, and I feel like I'm ready to move up soon. It's been a litte over a year since I was promoted to 
be a junior dev, and I feel like I've defintely grown a lot as a developer.

I think that I want to revamp this website a little bit, just to get back on track with my personal development work outside 
of employment. I think I wanna do some new stuff here, like set up the ability to publish blogs from the UI. That and I want
to redo the styling. One area that I feel like I've gotten really strong is with design and front end work, 
specifically with tailwind. I have a much stronger understanding of layout and especially flex box. I feel like I've been able
to take a design from our design team from scratch and recreate it pretty well without using other code as reference.

I'm not exactly sure of the limitations of Astro, and if it even makes sense to try and build a UI to submit my blogs, 
but I think it will be fun to figure it out anyway. For now, this is a good enough place to just type and write and just 
share my progress. 

Bye for now!
