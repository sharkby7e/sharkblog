### Creating a new Blog with Astro ðŸš€

Now that I'm working as a professional software developer at [Backerkit](https://backerkit.com), I decided that I needed a way to keep track of what I'm learning every day.

In the spirit of learning, I'm also trying out a couple new technologies to get this done:

- [Astro]("https://astro.build/"), a framework for building fast websites that reads markdown
- [Inkdrop]("https://www.inkdrop.app/"), to organize and plan my markdown
- [Vercel]("https://vercel.com/"), for deployment

I've already deployed the website, and you know that because you're on it! I used the domain <a href="https://www.sidquinsaat.com">sidquinsaat.com</a>, which has been a dead Squarespace site for the past few years. It originally was meant to show off my portfolio of choral conducting videos!

Once I deployed to Vercel, I had to hook up from there to the domain managed by Squarespace. This was pretty easy on Vercel, as they gave me all of the necessary names and addresses that I plugged in on squarespace, to get everything hooked up. I had never done anything with DNS before, so it was a good way to be introduced. [This article]("https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/domains#dns-records") in particular was very helpful in explaining the big picture of how everything gets connected, including the anatomy of a website address.
