### Creating a new Blog with Astro ðŸš€

Now that I'm working as a professional software developer at <a href = "https://backerkit.com" target= "_blank">Backerkit</a>, 
I decided that I needed a way to keep track of what I'm learning every day.

I've already deployed the website, and you know that because you're on it!
I used the domain sidquinsaat.com, which has been a dead Squarespace site for the past few years.
It originally was meant to show off my portfolio of choral conducting videos!

Once I deployed to Vercel, I had to hook up from there to the domain managed by Squarespace. 
This was pretty easy on Vercel, as they gave me all of the necessary names and addresses that 
I plugged in on squarespace, to get everything hooked up. I had never done anything with DNS before, 
so it was a good way to be introduced. 
<a href = "https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/domains#dns-records" target= "_blank">This article</a> 
in particular was very helpful in explaining the big picture of how everything gets connected, 
including the anatomy of a website address.
