### Starting as a Junior Dev at Backerkit

I am happy to announce that I will be starting my new position at <a href = "https://backerkit.com" target= "_blank">Backerkit!</a> I've had a fantastic time these past two months learning how to write enterprise code in a Rails App, and they were happy enough with my work to keep me on as a Junior Developer!

I don't believe that this will change my day to day much, but I hope to soon take on more responsibility, as well as to be trusted with the shaping and product design of our application as we move forward creating out new crowdfunding platform. Before April of 2022, Backerkit's main product was the "Pledge Manager" that helped creators who had launched campaigns on other platforms to fulfill the products of their campaign. In April, before my time, they decided to make the big leap into making their own platform, which we affectionately call "/c", pronounced "slash-c". 

I feel really fortunate to be joining BK at this super exciting time. I feel like there is a lot to learn, not only in Rails, but also in Product Engineering. I recently learned about the difference between 'software' engineers and 'product engineers,' and I have to say that I'm pretty excited to be at a place where I can grow both of those different skill sets. 

Wish me luck!
