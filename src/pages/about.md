Hello! My name is sid, and I sometimes go by sharkbyte.
I am currently working remotely as a junior software engineer for <a href = "https://backerkit.com" target= "_blank">Backerkit</a>.
Above you see me napping with my three cats Basil, Gigil and Finch
I enjoy spending time solving problems that are interesting.
I'm a singer and piano player, and I love listening to and making music.
